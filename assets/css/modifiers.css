/* This stylesheet is used to modify elements on spesific pages. When modifying an element, be sure to include the tag for whatever page you'd like to change it on.
For example, if I would like to change the height of the content div on the roster page, I would do so as follows:

#ROSTER .content {
	height: x;
}

Be sure to include the "#ROSTER" or "#INDEX" (etc.) tags or it will not work correctly. Be sure to space between the page tag and the element you're modifying.

If you add a new page to your website, be sure to create the ID (AKA #ROSTER, #INDEX, etc) for that page. To create an ID for that page, all you have to do is go into your code and look for the <body id="INDEX"> tag. This will then allow you to modify elements to that page by using that tag in this stylesheet. 

NOTE: If you need to edit an element on every page, do so in the main.css stylesheet, and be sure not to included the page spesific tags.

This is a lot to understand. If you need help, ask Ronnie. */
